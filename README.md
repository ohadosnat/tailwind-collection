# Tailwind Collection
This repository contains all of my projects using only Tailwind CSS for practice purposes. <br>
The designs I used are all made by myself a while ago for the **"Daily UI"** Challange, using `Figma` and `Sketch`. <br>
You can view it [here](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/index.html) (Main page with links to all the projects).
### **The Projects:**
- [**Movie App**](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/movie.html) - The design was originally made as a TV App but I used it anyway since I like the layout.
- [**Subscribe Form**](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/subscribe.html) - A simple newsletter form with a unique design, fun and challenging.
- [**Car Music Interface**](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/car-music.html) - a Car Interface Design that I did.
- [**Product Page**](https://ohadosnat.github.io/tailwind-collection/pages/product.html) - This was my first Tailwind CSS project, It was on a different repository but I decided to move it to this one to keep all of my project in one place.
